# VSC Packages

**(vsc-packages)**

A VSC extension to list packages from package.json and search for and install packages.

**This is a work-in-progress and has not been released yet. This project began so that I could learn how to make webviews for VSC extensions**

## Todo

- Add a search function
- Add ability to install a specific version or upgrade to a specific version
- Show uninstalled packages differently in the sidebar
- Show out-of-date packages differently in the sidebar
- Show unused packages differently in the sidebar
- Cache package data from NPM for a short time
- Cache selected tab in the revive state so that on revival the last active tab can be selected
